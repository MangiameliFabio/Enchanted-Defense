# Top Down Shooter
Currently, I'm working on this project. It is a custom engine in which I implemented a top-down shooter. The Engine is highly inspired by
the [LazyFoo SDL](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) tutorial series with whic I learned the basics of SDL and use their texture class for rendering.

For the Textures I used [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite). I'm not an artist so please excuse the simplicity of the textures :P

##Libraries
These libraries need to be installed to run the code.
